1.5.0  2018-09-13
  * $apply was incorrectly auto-vivifying its values to {} when they
    were null or undefined. This is technically a breaking change, but
    it's very unlikely anyone was relying on this buggy behaviour.
    (thanks George Kormaris)

1.4.0  2017-11-17
  * Support using $unset and $merge at same level as each-other, as
    well as recursion at the same level.
  * Added some docs describing what happens when multiple commands
    are used at the same level.

1.3.2  2017-10-03
  * Support arrays as paths in updatePath

1.3.1  2017-10-03
  * Experimental feature: updatePath

1.3.0  2017-10-03
  * Operation escaping: Now you can update updates with update. For
    example, if you have a key you want to update called "$set" then
    you can update it with the normal update language by referring to
    the key "$$set".

    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: If you were relying on keys that
    start with "$$" then add an extra "$" sign in front of them.

1.2.4  2017-08-08
  * When setting a field to undefined that is already undefined, don't
    return new object

1.2.3  2017-08-07
  * Ensure using $set to set an object key to undefined works
  * Add tests to demonstrate $set, $push, and $unshift preserve
    non-numeric keys

1.2.2  2017-07-11
  * Preserve non-numeric array keys when shallow copying
  * Improve error message slightly
  * Minor doc updates

1.2.1  2017-05-20
  * A few more tests for reference equality
  * TravisCI build status
  * Doc updates

1.2.0  2017-05-19
  * Preserve reference equality where possible (thanks George Kormaris)

1.1.2  2017-05-01
  * $unset now accepts either a single key or an array of keys
  * Document all the commands

1.1.1  2017-05-01
  * Properly include the compiled .js file in the npm distribution.
    (thanks Bernhard Gschwantner)

1.1.0  2017-04-24
  * Implement $apply (thanks George Kormaris)
  * Auto-vivify null as well as undefined (thanks George Kormaris)
  * More tests
  * Update docs

1.0.5  2017-04-20
  * Bugfix in $merge auto-vivification. An array would incorrectly
    be created instead of an object.
  * New tests for using $set to set items in an array
  * Add LICENSE file (2-clause BSD license)
  * Various documentation updates
    * Better description section
    * Section on autovivification feature
    * Add a see-also section to docs linking to known alternate
      implementations

1.0.4  2016-08-08
  * First production-ready release
